To ensure every work item is captured with clarity, properly scoped, and explicitly authorized before technical activity begins.

## Purpose
To ensure every work item is captured with clarity, properly scoped, and explicitly authorized before technical activity begins.

## When This Skill MUST Be Used
- Before any engineering, design, or investigation begins.
- When a request is made by a stakeholder or external team.
- When a new priority is introduced during a sprint or milestone.

## When This Skill MUST NOT Be Used
- When performing triage of alerts or incident response.
- For ad hoc exploratory efforts not intended to produce deliverables.

## Required Inputs (Fail-Closed)
- Written request or documented ask from stakeholder.
- Defined business objective.
- Initial scope boundaries (what is in/out).
- Named decision-maker.

## Pre-Execution Checks
- Confirm the requester has authority to initiate the work.
- Confirm the scope does not conflict with in-progress efforts.
- Validate that acceptance criteria are specified or request is returned.

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Identify the request origin and verify its legitimacy.
2. Confirm that the request includes business context and goals.
3. Require scoping information (inclusions, exclusions, constraints).
4. Identify stakeholders and confirm decision authority.
5. Record the request in the intake system (e.g., ticketing, backlog).
6. Validate acceptance criteria are testable and documented.
7. STOP: Reject intake if acceptance criteria or decision authority is missing.
8. Assign priority based on intake rubric (e.g., impact, urgency).
9. Confirm agreement on definition of ready.
10. STOP: Mark work item “INTAKE_APPROVED” only after all criteria are satisfied.
